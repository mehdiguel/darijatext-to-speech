# darijatext-to-speech
This is a python code script that generates MP3 audio using the gTTS library to convert text to speech.

This script does the following:

- It uses the gTTS library to convert the text to speech.
- It uses Arabic ('ar') as the language code, which is the closest available option for Darija.
- It saves the audio to a file, plays it using the playsound library, and then deletes the file.

Please note that this script uses standard Arabic pronunciation, which might not accurately reflect Darija's unique sounds and intonations. For a more accurate Darija text-to-speech system, you would need to develop or use a specialized model trained on Darija speech data.
